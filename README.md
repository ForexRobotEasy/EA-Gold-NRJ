## Introduction
EA Gold NRJ is an expert advisor (EA) designed for automated forex trading. It utilizes various filters and entry point strategies to open trades when optimal trading conditions are met. This code provides a basic framework for the EA's trading logic.

## Global Variables
- `tradeMagicNumber`: Magic number for trade identification

## Trading Logic
The EA follows a step-by-step process to determine when to open trades:

1. **Spread Filter**: Checks if the current spread is too high. If the spread is above a specified maximum value (10 in this code), the EA waits for optimal trading conditions.

2. **News Filter**: Checks if a news event is in progress. The implementation of news event detection logic is left to the user. If a news event is detected, the EA waits for market stabilization.

3. **Existing Trade Filter**: Checks if there are any open trades with the same symbol and magic number. If there are open trades, the EA waits for them to close.

4. **Trading Time Filter**: Checks if the current time is within the specified trading hours. The implementation of trading time logic is left to the user. If it is not within trading hours, the EA waits for the appropriate time.

5. **Entry Point Filter**: Checks if an optimal entry point is found. The implementation of entry point logic is left to the user. If no optimal entry point is found, the EA waits for favorable market conditions.

6. **Open Trade**: If all the above filters are passed, the EA opens a trade according to the specified trade opening logic. If the trade is successfully opened, a message is printed. Otherwise, an error message is printed.
